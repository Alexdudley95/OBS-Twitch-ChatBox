# OBS-Twitch-ChatBox
A simple browser source plugin for OBS which displays a chat box on screen.

#Be sure to edit the settings.js file before adding as a source on OBS - for this you would need a twitch token which can be generated from the below link:

Once setup, simply add the file as a browser source in OBS and use stylesheet.css to customise!
